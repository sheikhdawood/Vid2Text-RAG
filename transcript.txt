 What's the difference between generative AI and agentic AI? Well they're two distinct  approaches to artificial intelligence and I think we're all familiar with generative AI,  things like chat bots and image generators and the like, and they are really fundamentally  reactive systems. They wait for you to do something, specifically they wait for you  to prompt them and once you prompt them their job is to generate some kind of content based upon  what you provided in the prompt and they're using patterns they learned during training.  Now the things that it can generate, well that might be some text or it might be an image or it  might be a piece of code or it might be some audio. These are all sorts of things that we can generate  with generative AI and they're essentially sophisticated pattern matching machines. They've  learned the statistical relationships between words and between pixels and between sound  waves and they've learned that from massive data sets. So when you provide a prompt,  GenAI predicts what should come next based on its training, but its work does end at generation.  It doesn't take further steps without your input. Now agentic AI systems by contrast,  those are not reactive, they are proactive systems. Now like generative AI, they often  start with a user prompt, but that prompt is then used to pursue goals through a series of  actions and an agentic system basically goes through a bit of a life cycle. So the way this  works is it kind of first of all perceives its environment if you like and then once  it's done that it can decide an action to take. Once it's decided that action it can then execute  that action and then once that action has been executed it can kind of learn from the output  and then round and round we go, all with minimal human intervention. Now both of these  AI approaches often share a common foundation and that common foundation is large language  models or LLMs. LLMs serve as the backbone for chatbots and yet there's actually other  tools that are used for some of these other generative things, diffusion models typically  for images and audio, but for chatbots we use LLMs and LLMs also provide the reasoning engine  that powers agentic systems. But before we go any deeper into that let's talk about some real  world applications and use cases. Now maybe this doesn't put me in the best of lights, but I  don't think I'm the only one using generative AI to help with the task of content creation  and especially creative content creation. Now before work this morning, and this is  completely true, I used a chatbot to help write the next chapter of my Nelson Demille fan fiction  novel and right now you're probably thinking how profoundly cool and absolutely non-nerdy this  guy is, but for many of us gen AI does help with daily tasks. Like let's consider how a  YouTuber might use a generative AI system to review scripts and suggest thumbnail concepts and  maybe even generate background music, but at each step there is a human, there is a human creator  and that human creator is looking at this generated content and they are reviewing it,  check it's what they want, probably isn't, so then they are refining it as well and they  are really going through and directing this whole process. The AI generates possibilities  but the human curates them. Now agentic AI that kind of thrives in scenarios that require  ongoing management and consists of multi-step processes, so not just one thing at a time.  So consider a personal shopping agent. Given a product to purchase as input it actively hunts  for availability across platforms, it might monitor price fluctuations, it might handle  checkout processes and it might even coordinate delivery, largely by itself seeking input only from  you only when it's needed. But how does it do that? Well it turns out that the LLMs that  are behind much of generative AI can also be used to provide reasoning capabilities to AI agents.  So this essentially here we're using gen AIs ability to kind of think in inverted commas  there and it's thinking through problems and this has a name it's called chain of thought  reasoning and this is what LLMs are so very good at. It's a process where the agent basically  breaks down a complex task into smaller logical steps, kind of like how humans tackle difficult  problems as well. So let's imagine one, let's imagine that we want to have an agent that is  planning a complex task like organizing a conference. So what it's going to do is it's  going to use gen AI to generate an internal dialogue and that dialogue might go something  like this. It might say first I need to understand the conference requirements, so the size,  the duration, the budget, that sort of thing. Then I should research available venues matching  those parameters. Then it might think well for those venues that meet those requirements I  now need to check availability and so on. It's effectively the agent really kind of  talking to itself to explore the problem space before taking action. Gen AI is basically the  cognitive engine driving an agent's decision making. Now looking ahead the most powerful  AI systems probably won't be purely generative or purely agentic. They're going to be  intelligent collaborators. They'll understand when to explore options through generation  and when to commit to courses of action through agentic action. Like an agent that would know  when to generate the next chapter of fan fiction so it's ready after, oh I don't know,  a video shoot. Maybe, maybe it's ready right now.
